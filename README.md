# testQuiz
 A simple quiz app made within SwiftUI. Probably to remain unfinished, edit data and insert as needed


 All of the data is stored in the QuizQuestions file, which is still a new concept to me, therefore the implementation is not quite perfect, but it's getting there. 

 My goal is to work on this daily for a couple of months to see how far I can go, and how much I can learn along the way. 

 Travellers welcome, critizism and advice most appreciated.
