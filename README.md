# testQuiz
 A simple quiz app made within SwiftUI. Probably to remain unfinished, edit data and insert as needed


 All of the data is stored in the QuizQuestions file, which is still a new concept to me, therefore the implementation is not quite perfect, but it's getting there. 

 My goal is to work on this daily for a couple of months to see how far I can go, and how much I can learn along the way. 

 Travellers welcome, critizism and advice most appreciated. 


 Second commit notes Oct. 15 23' 3:03 AM : 
 Added more answer possibilities 
 Added a true or false detector
 Added a return button

 On the Radar: 
 A level selector
 Custom level creation
 Actual fucking questions
 Actual fucking settings (Like a uhh, you know, level resetor?? or maybe a backgrond color changer) 
 A super secret menu
 Music baybeeeee
 and much, much more. 

 Ah fuck im just learning about the fun formatting of readme.md, enjoy reading. Just WAIT until i learn how to upload photos here, or when i am NOT tired. Maybe I should just start a fucking google doc and link it here, I think that would be a more easy approach to what im using this for, (Some kind of programming journey journal). Oh well, heres to adding more to that soon to come journal. You know what?


 On the radar: 
Google doc
